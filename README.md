# esp01-php
use the esp01 to write to a Mysql backend
this will use the cheap ESP01 arduino board and upload to the data to a MySql backend.
there is sopme PHP pages that run on the web server so it all talks http.
it do https, but i did not see any reason to encrypt the data, it jsut adds load to the the ESP01
